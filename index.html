    <h1>Exploring the cutting with Scroll Saw</h1>
    <section class="intro">
        <p>Welcome to the official landing page of the Scroll Saw Project. Join us as we embark on an exciting journey to explore the cutting machines</p>

    <section class="project-details"><b>Project Details</b>
    <p>A scroll saw is a scroll held tool used to cut wood. Its cutting mechanism is 
        provided by removable blades which feature sharp teeth along their outer 
        edge. In most cases, a hacksaw consists of a metal frame that resembles a 
        downward facing. A handle of plastic, wood, or metal is typically affixed to one 
        end of the frame. The frame's ends feature adjustable pegs that can be 
        tightened to secure a blade in place, and loosened to remove it. Scroll saw 
        blades are long, thin strips of hardened steel that feature a row of teeth along 
        their cutting edge. Each end of the blade is punched with a small hole that fits 
        on to the saw frame's pegs. Most blades range in length from ten to 12inches 
        (25.4 to 30.48 cm).
        <br> <br>
         Although six-inch (15.24 cm) blades can be purchased to fit 
        smaller scroll saw models. A device that applies force, changes the direction of 
        a force, or changes the strength of a force, in order to perform a task, generally 
        involving work done on a load. Machines are often designed to yield high 
        mechanical advantage to reduce the effort needed to do that work. A simple 
        machines a wheel, a lever or an inclined plane. All other machines can be built 
        using combinations of these simple machines. Example: A drill uses a 
        combination of gears (wheels) to drive helical inclined planes (the drill bit) to 
        split a material and carve a hole in it.
